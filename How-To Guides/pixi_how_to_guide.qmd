# How to Set Up and Share a Python Environment Using Pixi

## Goal
Set up a reproducible Python environment using Pixi and share it with others via `pixi.toml` and `pixi.lock`.

## Step 1: Install Pixi

1. Go to the [official Pixi installation page](https://pixi.sh/latest/#installation).
2. On Windows, run:

```bash
winget install prefix-dev.pixi
```

3. Verify installation:

```bash
pixi --version
```

## Step 2: Initialize a Pixi Environment

```bash
pixi init
```

This command creates a `pixi.toml` file in the current directory.

## Step 3: Add Python and pip

```bash
pixi add python pip
```

This installs Python and pip from the `conda-forge` ecosystem.

## Step 4: Enter the Environment

```bash
pixi shell
```

You are now inside the managed environment.

## Step 5: Add Packages

Example:

```bash
pixi add numpy matplotlib
```

Or from PyPI:

```bash
pixi add --pypi streamlit
```

## Step 6: Share the Environment

1. Commit or send the `pixi.toml` and `pixi.lock` files.
2. Others can recreate the same environment by running:

```bash
pixi install
```

## Summary

You have successfully created and shared a Python environment using Pixi.
