# Learn Pixi by Managing a Python Environment for Data Analysis

## Goal
Learn how to use Pixi to create, manage, and reproduce a Python environment using only Pixiâ€™s core features.

## What You Will Learn

- How to install and verify Pixi
- How to create a new environment
- How to install packages from conda-forge and PyPI
- How to activate the environment and run commands
- How to export and share the environment

## Step 1: Install Pixi

Visit [pixi.sh](https://pixi.sh/latest/#installation) and follow the instructions for your operating system.

Example for Windows:

```bash
winget install prefix-dev.pixi
```

Verify installation:

```bash
pixi --version
```

## Step 2: Create a New Pixi Environment

Create a new project directory:

```bash
mkdir my-data-env
cd my-data-env
pixi init
```

This creates a `pixi.toml` file where your environment is defined.

## Step 3: Add Python and pip

```bash
pixi add python pip
```

Verify Python is available:

```bash
pixi shell
python --version
pip --version
```

Type `exit` to leave the shell.

## Step 4: Add Data Packages

Install useful packages:

```bash
pixi add pandas matplotlib
```

Install a PyPI-only package (such as `tabulate`):

```bash
pixi add --pypi tabulate
```

View environment info:

```bash
pixi info
```

## Step 5: Test the Environment

Create a file `test.py`:

```python
import pandas as pd
from tabulate import tabulate

df = pd.DataFrame({'A': [1, 2], 'B': [3, 4]})
print(tabulate(df, headers='keys', tablefmt='pretty'))
```

Run it inside the environment:

```bash
pixi run python test.py
```

## Step 6: Share or Reproduce the Environment

To share:
- Send `pixi.toml` and `pixi.lock`

To reproduce on another machine:

```bash
pixi install
pixi run python test.py
```

## Summary

You have now:

- Created a Pixi-managed environment
- Installed packages from both conda and PyPI
- Used `pixi run` and `pixi shell`
- Reproduced the environment with lock files
