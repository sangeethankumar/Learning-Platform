# Introduction to Python Basics

Welcome! This page introduces you to some of the basic building blocks of Python:
- Variables
- Arithmetic Operators
- Conditional Operators

You can run and edit each code block directly in your browser.

## Variables in Python

Variables are used to store data. You do not need to declare the type explicitly.

```{pyodide-python}
name = "Alice"
age = 25
height = 1.68

print("Name:", name)
print("Age:", age)
print("Height:", height, "meters")
```

---

## Arithmetic Operators

Python supports standard arithmetic operations:  
`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `//`, `%`, `**`

```{pyodide-python}
a = 12
b = 5

print("Addition:", a + b)
print("Subtraction:", a - b)
print("Multiplication:", a * b)
print("Division:", a / b)
print("Floor Division:", a // b)
print("Modulus:", a % b)
print("Exponentiation:", a ** b)
```

---

## Conditional (Comparison) Operators

Comparison operators are used to compare values:  
`==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`

```{pyodide-python}
x = 10
y = 20

print("x == y:", x == y)
print("x != y:", x != y)
print("x > y:", x > y)
print("x < y:", x < y)
print("x >= y:", x >= y)
print("x <= y:", x <= y)
```

---

## Try It Yourself

Edit the values and re-run the code!

```{pyodide-python}
# Try changing the values below
a = 15
b = 4

# What do you expect as output?
print("a + b =", a + b)
print("a > b?", a > b)
```

---

## Summary

- **Variables** store data without explicit type declarations.
- **Arithmetic operators** let you perform calculations.
- **Conditional operators** compare values and return `True` or `False`.

You now have the foundation to start writing basic programs in Python!
